ABSTRACT = {Accurately diagnosing schizophrenia, a complex psychiatric disorder, is crucial for effectively managing the treatment process and methods. Various types of magnetic resonance (MR) images have the potential to serve as biomarkers for schizophrenia. The aim of this study is to numerically analyze differences in the textural characteristics that may occur in the bilateral amygdala, caudate, pallidum, putamen, and thalamus regions of the brain between individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls via structural MR images. Towards this aim, Gray Level Co-occurence Matrix (GLCM) features obtained from five regions of the right, left, and bilateral brain were classified using machine learning methods. In addition, it was analyzed in which hemisphere these features were more distinctive and which method among Adaboost, Gradient Boost, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Naive Bayes had higher classification success. When the results were examined, it was demonstrated that the GLCM features of these five regions in the left hemisphere could be classified as having higher performance in schizophrenia compared to healthy individuals. Using the LDA algorithm, classification success was achieved with a 100% AUC, 94.4% accuracy, 92.31% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and an F1 score of 91.9% in healthy and schizophrenic individuals. Thus, it has been revealed that the textural characteristics of the five predetermined regions, instead of the whole brain, are an important indicator in identifying schizophrenia.},

ABSTRACT={<sec><title>Objective</title><p>Although distinctive structural abnormalities occur in patients with schizophrenia, detecting schizophrenia with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains challenging. This study aimed to detect schizophrenia in structural MRI data sets using a trained deep learning algorithm.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>Five public MRI data sets (BrainGluSchi, COBRE, MCICShare, NMorphCH, and NUSDAST) from schizophrenia patients and normal subjects, for a total of 873 structural MRI data sets, were used to train a deep convolutional neural network.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The deep learning algorithm trained with structural MR images detected schizophrenia in randomly selected images with reliable performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] of 0.96). The algorithm could also identify MR images from schizophrenia patients in a previously unencountered data set with an AUC of 0.71 to 0.90. The deep learning algorithmâ€™s classification performance degraded to an AUC of 0.71 when a new data set with younger patients and a shorter duration of illness than the training data sets was presented. The brain region contributing the most to the performance of the algorithm was the right temporal area, followed by the right parietal area. Semitrained clinical specialists hardly discriminated schizophrenia patients from healthy controls (AUC: 0.61) in the set of 100 randomly selected brain images.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The deep learning algorithm showed good performance in detecting schizophrenia and identified relevant structural features from structural brain MRI data; it had an acceptable classification performance in a separate group of patients at an earlier stage of the disease. Deep learning can be used to delineate the structural characteristics of schizophrenia and to provide supplementary diagnostic information in clinical settings.</p></sec>}}
